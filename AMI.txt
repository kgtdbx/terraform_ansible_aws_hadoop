AMIs for the workers and master can be found here:

* master  - AMI ID: ami-0a4e541fdec4711e1 AMI Name: Tolboom - Hadoop Master
* worker1 - AMI ID: ami-07bebc05b6f6f3c15 AMI Name: Tolboom - Hadoop Worker 1
* worker2 - AMI ID: ami-020206a4731ac1b7e AMI Name: Tolboom - Hadoop Worker 2
* worker3 - AMI ID: ami-04e4f03925cb5067f AMI Name: Tolboom - Hadoop Worker 3

These AMIs were setup by using the Terraform and Ansible scripts I created,
then creating the AMIs from the AWS EC2 console.

In general the configuration process is:

1. Remove java-1.7.0 and install java-1.8.0
2. Setup SSH keys on master (SSH default) and workers (auto generated)
3. Setup /etc/hosts for every node
4. Put Hadoop on every node
5. Copy the hadoop config files to every node
6. Setup hadoop/etc/workers on every node
7. Install java-1.8.0-devel on master
8. Start DFS and YARN on every node

More details can be found in the README file and in the comments of the
Terraform and Ansible scripts.
